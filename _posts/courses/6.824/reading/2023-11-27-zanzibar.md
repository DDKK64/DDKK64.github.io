# Zanzibar

Paper: Zanzibar: Google's Consistent, Global Authorization System

Relation-ship based access control (ReBAC)

Other access control models: mandatory access control (MAC), discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control.

## Data model

An ACL takes the form "user U has relation R to object O" or "set of users S has relation R to object O".

An authorization check takes the form "does user U has relation R to object O?"

### Relation tuples

ACLs are represented in **relation tuples**:

```
tuple = object '#' relation '@' user
object = namespace ':' object_id
user = user_id | userset
userset = object '#' 'relation'
```

`namespace` and `relation` are predefined enums by client.

Examples:

| Tuples                             | Semantics                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| doc:readme#owner@10                | User 10 is an owner of doc:readme              |
| group:eng#member@11                | User 11 is a member of group:eng               |
| doc:readme#viewer@group:eng#member | Members of group:eng are viewers of doc:readme |

### Namespace configuration

Client specifies their namespace configuration with a configuration language

- Relations
- Storage configuration: sharding settings

A relation consists of a client-defined name (viewer, editor, member, parent etc) and the config.
Complex relationship is expressed with user rewrite rules.

Example of namespace configuration:

```
name: "doc"
relation { name: "owner" }
relation {
  name: "editor"
  userset_rewrite {
    union {
      child { _this {} }
      child { computed_userset { relation: "owner" } }
}}}
relation {
 name: "viewer"
 userset_rewrite {
  union {
    child { _this {} }
    child { computed_userset { relation: "editor" } }
}}}
```

The config above defined a namespace named 'doc', a relation named owner, a relation named editor which contains all users who are owner, and a relation named viewer includes users whoc are editor.

The keyword `_this` includes all users defined in the relation tuples with specified relation. Indirect references are also included. This is the default rule.

Combining with the tuples above, we say user 10 is an owner, editor and viewer of doc:readme. User 11 can view doc:readme.

## Low latency and consistency

'New enemy' problem:

1. Alice removes Bob from the ACL of a file
2. Alice asks Charlie to write some new content
3. Bob may see the new content if ordering is neglected.

Order of ACL updates and content updates are important. Each update is associated with a timestamp.
Linearizability is powered using Spanner.

For low latency, most checks are evaluated with locally replicated data. The bounded staleness is gauranteed by using a zookie which is opaque to users.

A zookie encapsulate a Spanner timestamp. When a client checks for content-change autorization, a zookie is returned to represent the object version, which is guaranteed to be newer than all ACL writes prior to the check.
The zookie is stored along with the object and used later as a lower bound for queries related to the object.

In the problem before, with the zookie, the modified document has a greater timestamp than the ACL modification and Bob will not see the new content.

### API

Read:

- Specifies keys of tuples and an optional zookie.
- Results do not reflect user-rewrite-rules (do not follow references)

Reads in a request are processed as a single transaction.

If zookie is provided, the timestamp of the snapshot will not be ealier than the zookie's.
If zookie is not provided, reads are performed at local replicas with the newest possible snapshot.

Write: Single-tuple operation is atomic. Multi-tuple write is handle with optimistic concurrency control

1. Client read all required tuples, including a special 'lock' tuple (version number)
2. Client sends writes along with the lock tuple
3. Writes are committed if the lock tuple has not been modified

Watch: 

- Specifies the namespace and a zookie from which the watch starts
- All modification events are sent in order.
- Response contains a heartbeat zookie which can be used to resume watching.

Check:

- Specifies a user U and the `object#relation` pair to check against
- Using a snapshot not ealier than the time specified by the zookie

The rule is given as

Content-change check: a check without a zookie. It is evaluated with the latest snapshot.
If the request is authorized, the response contains a zookie that can be used as the content version.
The zookie is stored along with the document, which may or may not be visible to the end user.

Expand: returns effective usersets given an `object#relation` pair.

### Leopard indexing system

Maintain low latency with groups that are deeply nested or have a large number of children.

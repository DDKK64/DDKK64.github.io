# FaRM

Paper:
- FaRM: Fast Remote Memory
- No compromises: distributed transactions with consistency, availability and performance (2015)

Features:

- High performance trasactions
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Strict serializability
- Memory database
- Replication only within datacenter
- Novel hardware: DRMA and NV DRAM backed by UPS

## Hardware trends

- Cheaper DRAM
- Non-volitile DRAM
- RDMA

### Non-volitile DRAM

Distributed UPS: install Li-ion batteries on each rack. Save memory to reserved SSDs when power failure occurs.

Pros: cheaper than NVDIMMs.

### RDMA and Kernel bypass

Hardware-implemented connection-oriented reliable ordered transmission protocol.

Application sends and receives packets directly through user-space queues without trapped into the kernel:

- sending by put packets into sending queue
- receiving by polling receiving queue

The NIC handles packets in the queue without the kernel involved.

>Infiniband NIC

One-sided RDMA operations do not interrupt remote CPU: the NIC directly accesses memory.
One-sided writes are acknownledged by NIC.

## Programming model and architecture

Provides an abstraction of an address space that spans multiple machines in a cluster.

Space are diveded into 2GB regions, each of which are identified by a region ID.
Regions are primary/backup replicated.

Objects are always read from the primary. Reads are lock-free.

Objects are identified by region ID and offset within the region.

Objects are versioned for optimistic concurrency control.

Transactions are strictly serializable.

\
FaRM Configuration:

- Monotonically increasing configuration ID
- The set of machines in the configuration
- A mapping from machines to failure domains
- CM: a configuration manager

Zookeeper is used by servers to agree on a configuration.

CM maintains region mapping, allocation and replication:

- Load balance
- Failure domain
- User-defined colocation constraints

Each sender-reciever pair has its own log and message queue which are located at the receiver. 
The sender appends records by one-sided RDMA writes. A reader thread polls the queue for records.

## Distributed transactions and replication

- Unreplicated transaction coordinator.
- Optimistive concurrency control

Execution phase: Coordinator reads objects by one-sided RDMA and writes are buffered locally.

Commit phase:

1. Lock: for any written object
   - Cooridnator append a LOCK record(Object ID, new value, read version number) to the log of each primary
   - Objects are try-locked by CMP. Primary replies a message indicating the result. The CPU is involved in this step
2. Validate: for objects that are read but not written, if the version number has changed since execution phase, or the object is locked, the transaction is abort.
3. Commit backup: appned the COMMIT-BACKUP log record to the client. The content is the same as the LOCK record.
4. Commit primary: wait until all COMMIT-BACKUP is acked and then send COMMIT-PRIMARY record (transaction ID)
   - Update the objects at the primary and releasing the locks
   - Reports completion to the client on receiving at least one ACK from any primary
5. Truncate the log

Serialization point: end of the validate step

Commit point: the last primary committed.

Read of uncommited objects is impossible, since uncommited objects are locked until the primary committed.

Read-only transactions involve only one-sided RDMA reads.

## Failure recovery

The number of backups is the maximum fault tolerance.

### Failure detection

Both CM and any other machine hold leases for each other.

> why both??

Lease expiry triggers failure recovery.

Lease are short (several ms), even when under heavy load:

- dedicated queue pairs
- lease manager with highest user-space priority

### Reconfiguration

Precise membership: all machines in the new configuration must agree on its membership before any object mutation. Messages from/to a non member should be disallowed/ignored.

Reconfiguration steps:

1. Suspect: initiator try to become new CM.
   - Lease expired at CM: blocking all external client requests
   - Lease expired at non-CM: polls "backup CMS" (????) before timeout
2. Probe: new CM read-probes all machines except suspect ones and procedes only if obtains responses from a majority.
3. Update configuration: CM updates configuration in ZK by CMP.
4. Remap regions: new CM re-replicates lost regoins
5. Send new configuration: CM sends NEW-CONFIG message
6. Apply new configuration:
   - Stops communication with machines not in the new configuration
   - Blocking client requests
   - reply NEW-CONFIG-ACK message
7. Commit new configuration: CM waits for NEW-CONFIG-ACK message, and waits for leases in previous configration to expire, and then sends NEW-CONFIG-COMMIT 
to all members.

# Raft - A Consensus Algorithm

Paper: In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (2014)

Consensus algorithm cooridnates a set of machines to work as a cohenrent group (as if a single, highly reliable machine) that tolerate failures of some of its members.

Primary goal for Raft: understandability, compared with Paxos.

## Basic Idea: Replicated State Machines



## Algorithm

All servers share the same algorithm code.

Startup configuration:

- Election timeout
- A list of peers and their addresses

Persistent states:

- `currentTerm`: latest term server has seen (initialized to 0 on first boot, increases monotonically)
- `votedFor`: candidateId that received vote in current term (or null if none)
- `log[]`: log entries; each entry contains command for state machine, and term when entry was received by leader (first index is 1)

Persistent states only required by snapshot function:

- `lastIncludedIndex`
- `lastIncludedTerm`

Volatile states:

- `commitIndex`
- `lastApplied`
- `cntReceivedVote`: count received vote after sending RequestVote. Initialized to 1 (vote for itself) when requesting votes.
- `role`: either leader, candidate or follower. Initialized to follower on boot.

Volitile states only on leaders (initialized on leading):

- `nextIndex[]`
- `matchIndex[]`

AppendEntries RPC:

Server states transition:

### Startup

On boot, server initializes all states, reads persistent state and snapshot (if any) from stable storage and starts as a follower.

Each server keeps checking 


## Correctness

Raft properties:

- Election safety: at most one leader elected in a given term.
- Leader append-only: leader never overwrites or deletes its log.
- Log matching: if two entries have the same term and index, both entries and all preceding entries are identical.
- Leader completeness: if a log entry is committed, then the log will be present in the logs of leaders with higher term.
- State machine safety: at a given index, if an entry is applied, no server will apply different entry.

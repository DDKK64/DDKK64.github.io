# Amazon DynamoDB

Paper: Amazon DynamoDB: A Scalable, Predictably performant, and fully managed NoSQL Database Service

- Fully managed: serverless operational model
- Multi-tenant

## Data model

Tables of key-value pairs. Support values of various types.

CRUD API: Get, Put, Delete, Update

Support ACID transactions.

## Architecture

Constructed from multiple microservices.

Tables are partitioned by keys.

Partition is replicated across zones: replication group. Consensus with Paxos.

Partition map (from hash to storage node) is served by metadata service.

Write and strongly consistent read go to the leader. Eventually consistent read goes to any replica.

## On-demand probisioning

Serverless operational model measured by througput: read capacity unit (RCU) and write capacity unit (WCU).

Capacity unit: measured by tokens per second. Up to a specific item size, each request consumes 1 token. Token consumption grows with item size.

Based on token bucket.

Local buckets at request router obtain tokens from global admission control (GAC).
Request router allows requests to burst.

Non-uniform access patterns across partitions: heavily loaded partitions are split for higher throught based on applications' access pattern.

## Failure

Silent data errors: all logs and transfered data are checksummed.

Continuous verification

Software bugs:

- Core replication protocol verified by TLA+
- Failure injection and stress testing

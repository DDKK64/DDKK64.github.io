# Chain Replication

Paper: Chain Replication for Supporting High Thourghput and Availability

Approaches to Rplicated state machine:

- Build all operations into concensus algorithms (Raft/Paxos)
- Configuration service (zookerper) + Primary/backup replication

The second approach is more popular since it is modular and increases code reuse.
The first approach may suffer from huge log/snapshot difficulty.

Chain replication is a replication scheme of the second approach.

## Scheme

![](/assets/images/theses/cr-fig2.png)

A reliable FIFO (e.g. TCP) connects two servers. Updates are piped from the head through the chain.

A coordination service (a.k.a. master in the paper) is required to

- Detect server failures
- Informing chain configuration to servers and clients

Raft/Paxos are options.

### Client interaction

States of a request:

- Pending: an update is in process
- Ignored/lost
- Responsed

Clients split messages between the head and the tail.

Write request:

- Client sends request to the head
- The tail replies

Read request: both the request an response are handled by the tail

## Failure

Failure of the head: removes the head from the chain.
In this case, unforwarded messages are lost.

Failure of a middle node S:

1. The master informs the successor $S^+$ of the new predecessor $S^-$
2. $S^+$ replies the latest update it received.
3. The master informs $S^-$ to 

Each server maintains a list $Sent\_i$ of updates that has been forwarded but yet not acknowledged by the tail.
Once the tail finished an update, it sends an ack to its predecessor. The ack propagates backwards along the chain. 
A server can remove an update from the list when it is acknowledged.

Failures of the tail: the master informs the predecessor to become the new tail.

## Extending the chain

Extending the chain by appending at the tail is notably easier.

1. The master informs the old tail of the newconfiguration
2. The old tail sends data to the new tail, and at the same time handles requests and replies.
3. The master informs the clients of the new tail after completion.

## Extension: Sharding among multiple chains

To allebiate reading pressure of the tail, shard data across chains.

Multiple chains share the same set of servers:

```
C1: S1  S2  S3
C2: S2  S3  S1
C3: S3  S1  S2
```

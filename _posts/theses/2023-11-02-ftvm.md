# Primary Backup Replication

Paper: A Design of A Practical System for Fault-Tolerant Virtual Machines

Challenges in Primary-backup replication:

- Has the primary failed? Or is it brain-split?
- Keeps the primary/backup in sync
  - Retain the order of changes
  - Handle non-determinism
- Failover

Deal with **stop-failures**: servers failed by stop working rather than sending incorrect output. 

Examples of non-stop-failure:

- Logical error (bugs)
- Malicious attack

Primary-backup approaches:

- State transfer: replicating by transfering all state changes of vm
  -  Large bandwidth
- Replicated state machine: model a server as a state machine. Same initial state and inputs for primary/backup vm result in identical outpus
  - Extra coordination required for nondeterminism

E.g. GFS replication can be seen as the second approach.

## Deterministic replay

Basic ideas:

1. Inputs of the primary vm along with other information are sent to the backup vm by logging channel over network.
2. Outputs of the backup vm are dropped.

Inputs and nondeterminism are captured by hypervisor (VM FT):

- Inputs from I/O device: network, disk, keyboard
- Nondeterminism: interrupts(timer, io), reading timer.

Then sent to another hypervisor of the backup through a logging chanel.

The output of primary is delayed untile acked, and the output of backup is dropped.

Interrupts are deliverd at the exact same point in the instruction stream of the backup as the primary.
E.g. the interrupt arrives at the 100th instruction of the primary is also delivered to the backup at its 100th instruction.

Non-deterministic instruction are trapped into hypervisor (by modifying the binary beforehand). The instruction along with the result is sent to the backup.

The backup need to lag one message behind the primary, since the backup must know how many instructions it should execute. (Think of a busy-wait loop)

## FT protocol

After a failover, the backup's execution may diverge from the primary due to undelivered non-determinism and input.
E.g. the output may have been already sent to the client, but the input from client to primary is still not received by the backup. 
So the state of backup is not consistent from the client's view.

Output rule: the primary send output only after the bakcup acked log entries up to the output point.

Output requires delay, but the execution of primary can continue.

In the presence of failure:

- outputs may be duplicated
- inputs may be lost

Solution: cover the failure with unreliable network (packet duplicates/loss)

## Failure

Fiailure recovery:

- If the backup fails, the primary goes live: stops sending log and begins normal execution
- If the primary fails, the backup goes live: replays remaining log entries and begins normal execution. \
  Configure network device to enable the external output of the backup.

Failure detection:

- UDP heartbeat
- regular logging traffic (due to timer interrupts)

Solution to split-brain: before going live, vm executes an test-and-set on the shared storage. Go live only if opration succeds.

Storage failure: just wait

## Details

FT VMotion clones a vm to a remote host, sets up the logging channel, sets the primary to logging mode and sets the backup to replaying mode.
Interruption to the primary is typically less than 1 second.

vm redundancy is typically achived within minutes after failure.

\
Hypervisor maintains logging buffers for the primary/backup.

Primary stops execution if the log buffer is full. So CPU limit of the primary is dynamicly ajusted to keep pace with backup.

\
Special control entries: poweroff, resource adjustement...

\
disk IO race: serialize IO

\
Reducing delay: receive/send log without context switch.

## Alternatives

### Shared disk vs. nonshared disk

shared:

- disk write is external output and should be delayed

non-shared:

- explicit sync
- deal with split-brain

### disk reads at backup

reduce network usage

sync reads after failure

## Performance

Performance impact for FT vm and non-FT vm is relatively small.

Logging channel latency and bandwidth is important to achive high input/output bandwidth.
